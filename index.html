<h1>US Foreign Aid to the Top 5 War Torn Countries</h1>

<div id="economic">
  <h2>Overall Economic Assistance</h2>
  <p>The first graph displays the United States' foreign aid for the economic department in the five most war torn countries: <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-world-s-most-war-torn-countries.html">Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen</a>. Although not displayed, the disbursed aid before 1990 was not as large as it was after that year. The predicted reasoning is the U.S. entered Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 causing the aid to climb. With those countries having long-standing histories in wars, the economic stability wavers. It's also important to point out the U.S. was and continues to be personally involved with Afghanistan and Iraq which could support the reasoning they are given the most financial aid.</p>

  <h2>Disbursed Among Top 5 Sectors</h2>
  <p>This graph analyzes where the money of U.S. aid is divided into. As stated above, with our military tie to Afghanistan, we give the most money of 4.5 billion to their 'Conflict, Peace and Scoiety' sector. Recently in 2016, U.S. has used its resources to devote to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-47391821">rebuilding the Afghan army</a> instead of fight the battle for them. However, from a different perspective, the U.S. gave more money to Afghanistan than Yemen, even when Yemen had a larger 'Emergency Response' than Afghanistan. From examining both graphs, Afghanistan takes the lead in the largest amount of foreign aid to be received of the five war torn countries.</p>
